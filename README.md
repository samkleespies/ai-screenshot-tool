# AI Screenshot Tool

A Windows desktop app built with Electron and Node.js that lets you screenshot an area of your screen, then the tool will automatically open a new ChatGPT chat or Cursor chat and paste the screenshot for you.

## What's New in v1.2.0 ðŸš€

Just shipped a bunch of fixes that make the app way more reliable:

- Fixed the annoying selection window bug that was preventing click and drag from working
- Made the app start up faster and feel snappier overall
- Fixed issues with hotkey configuration (they actually save properly now!)
- Added better logging to help track down any weird behaviors
- Maintained the clean look while making everything work better under the hood

Check the [Release Notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for the full details!

- **Cursor Chat Integration**: Paste screenshots directly into Cursor chat
- **ChatGPT Integration**: Paste screenshots directly into ChatGPT
